🎄 About

A unique, emotionally-driven web experience created as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. The project challenged me to quickly prototype and creatively express an idea, all within a tight deadline.

👨🏻‍💻 Skills: 
- Creative design
- Project planning
- Rapid execution
 
✨ Features
- 🌞 Daily Kind Message - A different sweet, uplifting message is displayed each day. These messages are meant to brighten your partner's morning and bring a smile daily.
- ❤️ Days Together Counter - Displays a live count of how many days you've been together as a couple — a simple but powerful reminder of your shared journey.
- 🎵 Shared Spotify Playlist - A direct link to a shared Spotify playlist that contains songs meaningful to your relationship or simply tunes you both love.
- 🎬 Movies & Series To Watch List -  A collaborative list where you can add and remove titles of movies or series you want to watch together. It helps you never forget what you were planning to watch on your next cozy night in.
- 📝 Activities / Programs To Do List -  Similar to the watchlist, this section allows you to manage a shared list of date ideas, adventures, or fun tasks you want to do together. New entries can be added or deleted dynamically.
- 📸 Photo Gallery - A memory wall of photos that showcase your favorite moments as a couple. This feature helps keep visual memories just a click away.
- ☕ Cafe Map - A custom map showing all the cafes you've visited together. Each cafe is marked on the map, creating a romantic visualization of your shared coffee adventures.
- 📅 Shared Calendar with Events & Weather - A personalized calendar where you can add upcoming events and assign a city to each. For each event, the app attempts to fetch the weather forecast for that city and date.
- 🌦️ Weather Forecast Widget (Location-based) - Integrated weather information is pulled for cities attached to your shared events. Note: Due to limitations of the free weather API and browser security (CORS), weather data may occasionally fail to load.
